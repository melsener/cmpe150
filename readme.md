- Lab slides and extra exercises will be uploaded weekly.

## QUICK FIX
If your computer executes `printf` after `scanf` even if their order is vice-versa, please write this in the beginning of your code 

`setbuf(stdout, NULL);`

## Home Exercises
**Ex0:** Write a program that takes three integers from the user and displays their sum on the screen.

**Ex1:**  Write a program that accepts the weight of apples and the weight of the bananas (both are float) you're buying. Then take the 1 kg price of the apples and bananas (both are float). Calculate the total price you're paying.

**Ex2:** Write a program to convert a given integer (in seconds) to hours, minutes and seconds.

**Ex3:** Write a program that takes mass of an object as an input (in double datatype) and calculates its weight on the Earth. Use `#define`preprocessor directive. Give output with 3 decimal places.

**Ex4:** Write a program that takes a char as shape type (c for circle, s for square, t for triangle, h for hexagon) and takes a float (radius for circle, one side length for the rest) and calculates and prints the circumference of the desired shape.

**Ex5:** Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 
(Each number is sum of the previous two numbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1 which are predefined) Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N.th fibonacci number. (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 3)

**Ex6:** Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD). (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 7)

**Ex7:** Write a program that will take an integer N and print all the numbers that are divisible by either 2 or 3 from 1 to N (included). (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 9)
	- Assume N > 0 
	- Don't print numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.
