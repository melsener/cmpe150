## This week's homework (Teaching Codes - Lab6 Q2 )
Write a function named divideWithRemainder which takes two integer values: number and divisor, and two integer pointers (addresses of two integers): result and remainder. This function should divide the number by divisor, then write the result into the address given by result, and write the remainder into the address given by remainder.

In the main program, create four integers: a,b,c,d. Then read the values of a and b from the user. Then call the function with the values of a and b, and the addresses of c and d, respectively. Your function will divide a by b, and the value of c will be the result, and the value of d will be the remainder. Then print out the values of c and d.

Note that this function doesn't need to return anything, because it is already able to give output to the given addresses.

Also note that, before calling a function with pointer inputs in the main program, you should first create appropriate variables so that you can give proper addresses to that function.
