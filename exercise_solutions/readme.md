**Ex5:** Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 
(Each number is sum of the previous two numbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1 which are predefined) Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N.th fibonacci number. (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 3)

**Ex7:** Write a program that will take an integer N and print all the numbers that are divisible by either 2 or 3 from 1 to N (included). (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 9)
	- Assume N > 0 
	- Don't print numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.
