## Nested Loops - Exercises

**Ex1:** Write a program that takes an integer from the user and prints the multiplication table from 1 to given number.

- Example Input: 4

- Example Output:

  ``1	2	3	4	``

  ``2	4	6	8``	

  ``3	6	9	12``	

  ``4	8	12	16 ``

**Ex2: (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 2)** Write a program which reads two integers N and M (both smaller than 15, greater than 1) then prints a rectangle with size NxM which has stars (*) at borders, and lines (-) inside.

- Example Input: 3 3

- Example Output:

  ``***``
  
  ``*-*``

  ``***``
  
- Example Input: 4 8

- Example Output:

  ``********``
  
	``*------*``

	``*------*``

	``********``

**Ex3: (Teaching.Codes Lab 4 - Question 11 )** Write a program which takes an integer N as input and prints a right triangle which consists of N many lines. 

- Example Input: 3 
	
- Example Output:
		``*``
		
		``**``
		
		``***``

**Ex4: (Teaching.Codes PS 7 - Page 3 )** Write a program that reads an integer value, and computes the sum of the factorial of each digit . The output will be an integer . For example, assume that the user enters "572" as the input integer. For each digit of the integer, you will compute the factorial. Then you will compute the sum of these factorials: 5! + 7! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 2 = 5162.

**Ex5: (Teaching.Codes PS 7 - Page 3 )** Draw the isosceles triangle using \*, where line number is also specified by the user.

**Ex6:** Write a program which takes an integer as input and prints a triangle of letters as shown below:
- Input: 3
- Output: 

	``      A`` 
	
	``    A B A``
	
	``  A B C B A``
	
- Input: 5
- Output:

	``          A`` 
	
	``        A B A`` 
	
	``      A B C B A`` 
	
	``    A B C D C B A`` 
	
	``  A B C D E D C B A``
