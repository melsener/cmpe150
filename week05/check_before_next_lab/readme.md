### Please Check Examples in This Folder

- In the last lab session, I wanted you all to check the examples in PS - 7, page 2 Factorial and PerfectNumber exercises. Solutions are here:

  [Factorial](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/factorial.c)  

  [PerfectNumber](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/perfect_number.c)  

- Please check a couple of examples from Lab4. Solutions are here:

	 [Lab4-Question4](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/lab4_q4.c)
	
	[Lab4-Question6](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/lab4_q6.c)


- Please check further topics we could not covered in the last lab sessions. See [slides](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/break_continue.pdf) of ``break`` and ``continue`` keywords. Then check the examples:

	[Continue](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/continue.c)
	
	[Break](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/break.c)
	
	[For Loop with "continue" and "break"](https://github.com/melsener/cmpe150/tree/master/week05/check_before_next_lab/for_loop_continue_break.c)

**Note:** We will cover ``break`` and ``continue`` at the beginning of the next lab session. Please study this material before the lab.
